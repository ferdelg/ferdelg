# 👋 Hi, I’m María Fernanda del Granado

🎓 I’m a Computer Science and Statistics double major at Carleton College (Class of 2027), passionate about using data, machine learning, and backend development to build meaningful, scalable tech solutions.  
🌎 Originally from Bolivia, I bring an international perspective shaped by growing up across Chicago, Mexico City, and Cochabamba.  

I'm especially interested in ethical AI, open data, and using technology to solve real-world challenges. I’m currently exploring opportunities in machine learning engineering and data science, while actively contributing to impactful research and coding projects.
